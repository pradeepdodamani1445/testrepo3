  "summary": "OV-GTFS-Kit is simple work with GTFS and public transport map overlays",
  "description": "OV-GTFS-Kit is a powerful and versatile library designed to streamline the handling of General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, \tfacilitating the creation of map overlays for public transportation systems. GTFS is a standardized format for public transportation schedules and related geographic information, and OV-GTFS-Kit simplifies the process of working with this data to generate insightful and visually appealing map overlays.\n\nWith OV-GTFS-Kit, developers can efficiently extract, parse, and manipulate GTFS data, enabling them to seamlessly integrate public transportation information into mapping applications. The library provides a range of functionalities, including the ability to plot routes, stops, and schedules on maps, making it an invaluable tool for creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces that showcase public transport networks.\n\nWhether you're building a transportation-focused app, analyzing transit data, or enhancing the user experience of a mapping platform, OV-GTFS-Kit offers a comprehensive set of tools. Its ease of use, coupled with its robust capabilities, makes it a go-to solution for developers looking to leverage GTFS data and create dynamic map overlays that enhance the understanding and accessibility of public transportation systems.",
